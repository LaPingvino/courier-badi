    Courier Badi is a version of Courier Prime made to add characters that can be relevant to Bahá'ís in the widest possible sense.
    Short term this means adding the Bahá'í Nine Pointed Star and dot below characters, long term this will probably mean e.g. adding
    Arabic monospace characters in the same style as the rest of the font for as much as I manage to do that.
