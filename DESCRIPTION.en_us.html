    Courier Badi is a version of Courier Prime made to add characters that can be relevant to Bahá'ís in the widest possible sense.
    It adds the Bahá'í Nine Pointed Star, dot below characters and monospace Arabic. It also includes Russian letters from another
    Courier Prime fork and Greek letters from the same source as the Arabic letters.
